    In-vessel molecular communications: prototype. The transmitter uses a pump to release acid or base into the fluid flowing through the tube, which propagates to the receiver, a pH sensor. The microcontroller (<i>Arduino</i>) is used to interface the transmitter/receiver to a computer.

Develop MIMO testbed to enhance transmission speed of molecular communication.

A testbed was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of molecular communication in a confined environment, such as a tube, where fluid flow is present. Since the system uses a change in pH to convey information, acids or bases are used as the information-carrying medium.

A pump, which acts as the transmitter, emits the acid or base and also creates the fluid flow within the tube. To detect the pH change, a pH sensor is used as the receiver, and a connected <i>Arduino</i> transmits the signal to a computer.
